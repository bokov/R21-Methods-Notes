<h1 data-label="855590" class="ltx_title_section">Methods</h1><h2 data-label="590811" class="ltx_title_subsection">Data Sources</h2><div>We have access to identified local copies of surgical registry data submitted by STVHS to the VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP)  <cite><a href="#daley_validating_1997">(Daley 1997)</a></cite> and by UHS to the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) <cite><a href="#fuchshuber_power_2012"></a></cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{bilimoria_development_2013}</cite>. These sources, to which we will collectively refer to&nbsp; provide information about patient demographics, comorbidities, functional status, whether or not the patient is community-dwelling, 30-day mortality, and 30-day re-admission. In total, our data spans the years 201X to 2016 and includes XX,XXX surgeries -- XX,XXX from VASQIP and XX,XXX from ACS NSQIP. The demographic characteristics of these patients are shown in [table 1]. In addition we have access to database extracts of data from the electronic medical record systems (EMR) of STVHS and UHS, as well as several public data sources that will be described in the next section.</div><h2 data-label="121793" class="ltx_title_subsection">Data Linking and Extraction</h2><div>We will use patient and visit record numbers to link </div><h2 data-label="595076" class="ltx_title_subsection">Analysis</h2><div>We will calculate the surgical administrative risk assessment index (RAI-A) for patient records in the VASQIP&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hall_development_2017}</cite> and NSQIP&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{isharwal_preoperative_2017,melin_preoperative_2015}</cite> registries of STVHS and UHS, respectively. This RAI-A score will be used as the predictor to fit Cox proportional hazard models <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{cox_regression_1972}</cite> for time from surgery until first unplanned re-admission and until mortality. We will update these models with the following additional variables: race, gender, Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, and median household income and use bi-directional stepwise regression&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{venables_modern_2002}</cite> to find a parsimonious set of demographic covariates that significantly improve predictive accuracy. Separate randomly selected subsets of the data will be used for model development and model validation. </div><div></div>
