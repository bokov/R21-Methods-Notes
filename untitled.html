We will update these models with the following additional variables: race, gender, Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, and median household income and use bi-directional stepwise regression&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{venables_modern_2002}</cite> to find a parsimonious set of demographic covariates that significantly improve predictive accuracy. Separate randomly selected subsets of the data will be used for model development and model validation. </div><div></div>
